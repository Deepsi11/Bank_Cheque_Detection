# Bank_Cheque_Detection
Steps Involved:- 



Step 1:- Preparing the dataset, downloaded the cheque imagges and labeled the text of cheques by creating a bounding box and tagging the label using LabelImg. 



Step 2:- Extracting the Object info from Xml Files. 


Step 3:- label encoding the data set, by converting the text to numerical values.


Step 4:- Splitting the dataset into train and test set. 


step 5:- Loading the dataset in respectinng train and test folder. 


step 6:- cloning the yolo v5 then training the model using it. 


step 7:- using the onnx file that aligns well with opencv. 


Step 8:- Downloading the trained model and Preparing the matrix to superimpose the new image. 


Step 9 - Deciding the size, colour and location of bounding box, plus the predictions in percentage. 


Step 10:- Then making predictions on new image using OpencV
